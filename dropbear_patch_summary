# ARM Core's dropbear patches
1. Use /bin/sh instead of /usr/sbin/cli
original:
`0001A81B "/usr/sbin/cli",0`
patched:
`0001A81B "/bin/sh",0`
reason: 
So it spawns the shell instead of the proprietary cli app.
2. Don't pass extraneous argvs to /bin/sh
original:
`000101E8 LDR     R2, =aL`
patched:
`000101E8 MOVS    R2, #0`
reason:
So ARGV is only 1 element long while calling execv(); otherwise it'll pass weird arguments that the original "cli" used.
